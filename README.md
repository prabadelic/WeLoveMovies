# WeLoveMovies

This is a Full-stack application project called [**WeLoveMovies**](https://welovemovies-frontend-8wb2.onrender.com/), built to manage and display information about movies, theaters, and reviews. The backend is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, and the frontend is developed in React. The application allows users to browse a list of movies, view theater details, and see and edit reviews.
